# vagrant-saltlab

Using Vagrant to run a portable [Salt](https://saltproject.io/) lab environment [on my Chromebook](https://www.virtuallypotato.com/create-vms-chromebook-hashicorp-vagrant/). The included Vagrantfile spawns a environment with a single Salt Master and four Salt Minions running on a few different common Linux distributions for testing and development.
